# Ideas, issues, improvements, and potential features:
- man pages
- -h for brief-help (including a supposition to use --help)
... , --help for longer help
... -h will use POSSIBLE_PARAMS=()
... --help => _help_verbose()
... --help => _help_brief()
- completion
- install with make/config/w.e.
- Printing the proper command-invoke, with ssh-params: 
while ; ; ; <(ssh -g)
(non-ssh-config-contingent)
- if user doesnt have a key ON github
- useradd to create a user with the requested UN, if none currently exists

# Advanced key-user association-mgmt
- If -k is supplied, prompt to ask for a NAME for the key, storing it 
.... in the $HOME/.bless directory
- Being able to auth by ssh-points: 
(so that different servers can "talk to one another", directly)
... can ssh into e.g. mango, and arturo, and you want to bless mango for arturo
    # Could use MasterController to pipe all these commands to the ssh-point
    - check if they have a key
    - if not, generate it
    - then pipe it in
- add a comment next to the key, on-server
- cache the keys in a "keyring"
# ALT: use gpg's fxnality of the keyring
